# Lab 3

See Canvas for the lab assignment details.

Remember to modify CMakeLists.txt if you add any .cpp files!
It's also good practice to add the .h files.

## Building and Running

Set up:
```bash
cmake -B build -S .
```

Then:
```bash
cmake --build build
./build/Lab3  # .\build\Debug\Lab3.exe on Windows
```

Or, if on Windows, use the generated Visual Studio project to build and run.
